##### **Course Descriptions**

The course is designed for freshmen who nearly have no programming experience, and aims to cultivate them on basic concepts and techniques of programming. Students will learn Java programming language, understand basic elements of programming and fundamental program structures, and use Java to solve simple programming problems.

On completion of this course, the students should be able to: 

- Understand the basic components in a software system and the working mechanism of the Internet and the Web. 
- Know the basic syntax of the Java programming language. 
- Understand the features of object-oriented programming: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism. 
- Develop programs to solve real problems using integrated development environments.


##### **Course Materials**

- All the lecture and lab slides.

- Textbook (optional): David J. Eck, Introduction to Programming Using Java, Eighth Edition.

##### **Course Workloads**

There will be several programming assignments, a project, and a final examination. 


##### **Grading Policy**

<!--- The grading policy may subject to minor changes depending on the overall performance.-->

- Programming assignments, 30%

- Attendance and exercises, 10%

- Project, 20%

- Final exam, 40%


##### **<span style="color:red;">Academic Integrity/Academic Dishonesty</span>**

I expect students to be honest and not cheat on their assignments, project, or exams. 
Please refer to the [plagiarism policy](/assets/Plagiarism_Policy.pdf) (**IMPORTANT!!! Please READ carefully!!!**) of CSE department for more details.
You MUST sign the commitment letter and submit on the Sakai/Blackboard system.


##### **Course Policies**

- No late assignment will be accepted.
- Unless some special situations (e.g., medical leave) which will be reviewed by all the instructors.
- The following excuses will NOT be approved for late submissions: computer crashes, disk crashes, accidental file deletions, lab computer unavailability, and the like. There will be no reply for this sort of late assignment submission requests.
