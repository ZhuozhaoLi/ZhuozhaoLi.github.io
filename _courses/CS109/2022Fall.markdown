##### **Course Descriptions**

The course aims to cultivate students who have programming experience before their university study. In this course, we will introduce the fundamentals of computer programming and common programming techniques using a popular object-oriented programming language, Java. The students will be familiar with computer programming and be able to construct programs for solving complex computing problems.

On completion of this course, the students should be able to: 

- Understand the basic components in a software system and the working mechanism of the Internet and the Web. 
- Know the basic syntax of the Java programming language. 
- Understand the features of object-oriented programming: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism. 
- Develop programs to solve real problems using integrated development environments.


##### **Course Materials**

- All the lecture and lab slides

- Textbook (optional): P. Deitel, H. Deitel, Java: How to Program (11th edition), Prentice-Hall, 2017.

##### **Course Workloads**

There will be five programming assignments, a project, and a final examination. 

##### **Grading Policy**

<!--- The grading policy may subject to minor changes depending on the overall performance.-->

- Programming assignments, 30%

- Lecture attendance and quizzes, 5%

- Lab attendance and exercises, 5%

- Project, 20%

- Final exam, 40%

##### <span style="color:red">**Academic Integrity/Academic Dishonesty**</span>

I expect students to be honest and not cheat on their assignments, project, or exams. 
Please refer to the [plagiarism policy](/assets/Plagiarism_Policy.pdf) (**IMPORTANT!!! Please READ carefully!!!**) of CSE department for more details.
You MUST sign the commitment letter and submit on the Sakai/Blackboard system.

##### **Course Policies**

- No late assignment will be accepted.
- Unless some special situations (e.g., medical leave) which will be reviewed by all the instructors.
- The following excuses will NOT be approved for late submissions: computer crashes, disk crashes, accidental file deletions, lab computer unavailability, and the like. There will be no reply for this sort of late assignment submission requests.
