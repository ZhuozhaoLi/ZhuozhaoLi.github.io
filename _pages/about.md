I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), Shenzhen, China.
Before joining SUSTech, I was a postdoc in [Globus Lab](http://labs.globus.org/){:target="\_blank"} at [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, hosted by [Ian Foster](http://www.ianfoster.org/){:target="\_blank"} and [Kyle Chard](https://kylechard.com/){:target="\_blank"}. I earned my Ph.D. in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/){:target="\_blank"} in May 2018, under the supervision of [Haiying Shen](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hs6ms/){:target="\_blank"} 
I received the B.E. degree <!--- in [Optical Engineering](http://opt.zju.edu.cn/english/){:target="\_blank"} --->
from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/){:target="\_blank"}, China in 2010,
and the M.S. degree <!--- in [Electrical Engineering](http://ee.usc.edu/){:target="\_blank"} --->
from [University of Southern California](http://www.usc.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, USA in 2012.

My research interests include High Performance Computing, Distributed System, Cloud/Edge Computing, and Internet of Things.
